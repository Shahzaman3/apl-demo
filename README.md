## 🏏 Hero Overview

**CricIntel** is an elite, analytics-focused visual deduction platform engineered exclusively for Indian Premier League (IPL) enthusiasts. Unlike traditional hardcoded branching tree trivia, CricIntel employs an advanced **Bayesian Probability Engine** that operates on real-time probability distributions across **251 pre-indexed historic and modern IPL players**. 

The dashboard mirrors actual data science command screens, visualizing conditional entropy updates, sequential filtering logs, and instantaneous player pool collapses as the predictive engine isolates the target player in under 8-10 moves.

---

## 🧠 Architecture & Scientific Core

### 1. Mathematical Deduction Loop
*   **Shannon Conditional Entropy**: During each cycle, the engine calculates information gains $IG(T, Q) = H(T) - H(T|Q)$ for all unasked questions against active player priors. It dynamically chooses the question offering the maximum theoretical variance split.
*   **Soft Bayesian Updating**: Answer evaluations incorporate noise tolerance scaling ($YES/NO$ mapped at $0.95/0.05$, $MAYBE$ at $0.60/0.40$), preventing accidental user errors from prematurely collapsing the distribution.
*   **Immersive Suspense Floor**: A strict, user-mandated minimum floor of **8 questions** ensures a fully paced Akinator-style build-up before offering verified prediction outcomes.

### 2. Performance Supercharging
*   **RAM static dataset caching**: Static player reference records are loaded from MongoDB into application heap memory on server boot using `.lean()` objects, bypassing expensive disk reads and making calculations virtually **instantaneous (< 0.5ms)**.
*   **Windows IPv4 Resolution Bypass**: Configured database connection URIs to directly reference `127.0.0.1` loopback addresses, completely eliminating the 2-second IPv6 fallback delay commonly experienced in dual-stack Windows environments.

## 🛠️ Comprehensive Tech Stack

- **Core Framework**: Next.js 14 (Unified App Router Architecture for Seamless API/UI)
- **State Persistence**: MongoDB & Mongoose ODM (Connection pooling optimized)
- **AI Coprocessor**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash API (Generates real-time intelligence briefs)
- **Interface Aesthetics**: Tailwind CSS with Custom CSS Variables & Atomic Typography
- **Visual Interactivity**: Framer Motion physics-based spring animations

## 🚀 Easy Deployment & Operation

CricIntel supports two main deployment models: one-click orchestrations for container environments, and standard native Node executions.

### 📦 Method 1: Docker Orchestration (Highly Recommended)
Spin up the complete full-stack environment—including the app server, dedicated database instance, and a visual admin GUI—using a single terminal command:

```bash
# 1. Start containerized ecosystem in background mode
docker-compose up -d --build
```
*   🌐 **Main Web Application**: `http://localhost:3333`
*   💾 **Visual Database Explorer (Mongo-Express)**: `http://localhost:8081`

---

### 💻 Method 2: Native System Startup

Ensure a local `mongodb` service is running on port `27017` before initiating.

```bash
# 1. Install standard packages
npm install

# 2. Provision environment overrides (Setup MONGO & GEMINI)
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Boot Next.js in explicit port-bound development mode
npm run dev -- -p 3333
```

---

### 🏏 Critical Last Step: Database Seeding
When initially installing the repository, the database collection will be empty. CricIntel features a frictionless, one-click browser hydration utility to populate **251 professional players** automatically:

👉 Open your browser and navigate once to: **`http://localhost:3333/api/db/seed`**

A confirmation JSON message will display, signifying the static reference pool is fully populated and the server-side RAM cache has successfully synchronized!

## 🤖 Artificial Intelligence Feature Map

Upon completing active mathematical deduction trails, CricIntel's result pipeline bridges directly with the **Google Gemini Flash** large language model:
1. Extracts peak mathematical player candidates.
2. Maps player context and unique statistics directly to AI inference prompts.
3. Streams robotic, hyper-analytical **1-Sentence Intelligence Reports** (e.g., *"Execution algorithm successfully isolated: Virat Kohli displays dominant top-order anchor metrics."*) directly onto the final dashboard.

*(Elegant placeholders will automatically trigger in dev environments lacking active `GEMINI_API_KEY` variables).*
